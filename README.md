# SokoCode
A small sokoban + programming game with 15 puzzles and a programmign language reminiscent of some zachtronics games.  This is for the NETronics Connect in the game Last Call BBS from Zachtronics.

To get started, copy the file SokoCode.js to the server file for Last Call BBS and select the server in NETronics Connect.

I'd appreciate any feedback or ideas for mechanics or levels.
